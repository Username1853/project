  Minecraft (from the English mine craft - lit. "mining craft") is a video game in the genre of sandbox in an open world with a first/third-person perspective, developed and published by Mojang Studios in 2011. The game began a series of the same name, all works of which are characterized by a minimalist cubic design.

The game was developed in 2009 by Swedish programmer Markus Persson, also known as "Notch", and is further developed by the company Mojang, founded by Markus Persson, which is owned by Microsoft Studios. Minecraft is one of the games with the widest audience and is recognized as the best-selling video game in history.[6]
Game modes
Creativity. This mode offers minimal restrictions and allows for the unhindered creation of any objects. Players immediately receive an infinite number of all types of blocks and equipment. All blocks are destroyed with one blow, regardless of the weapon in their hands. Thanks to this, players can create both huge three-dimensional buildings like castles, and engage in pixel art - creating two-dimensional pictures from multi-colored blocks. In creative mode, you can also easily create automatic mechanisms using a special material - redstone, which transmits signals. A character in "Creative" mode cannot die, the exception is falling into the void, the space that limits the game world, or using a special command /kill). Since Minecraft beta 1.8, he can fly if the player double-clicks the jump key (usually Space). Monsters in this mode do not cause any damage and by default do not react to the player at all. This is the only mode available in classic versions of Minecraft and the main one for the game. It is also available in the beta version after the Adventure Update.

Survival. Here the player must travel and search for the necessary blocks, fight mobs, farm, produce new materials and craft tools. Here, in addition to the inventory, the character has a health, hunger and experience scale. Health is represented by heart symbols, which are lost when the character is attacked, falls from a great height, falls into lava, or suffers other damage. Health is replenished by consuming food. Hunger is represented by chicken legs symbols, which are gradually consumed automatically. When they run out, food stops replenishing the health supply. Once underwater, the little man can stay underwater until he runs out of air (displayed as bubbles). With the destruction of enemies (personally, but not due to the action of the environment), experience spheres fall out of them, which must be picked up to fill the experience scale. Later, it is used to enchant objects, giving them special properties, or repair them. In the event of exhaustion of health (death), the player is offered to revive the character at the initial spawn point (appearance), but then he will lose all the contents of the inventory, and he is also offered to exit to the main menu.

Adventure. A mode based on tabletop role-playing games. There is no ability to destroy or install blocks, but you can travel and interact with objects and mobs.

Hardcore. Similar to "Survival" except that the hardest difficulty is used and there is no ability to revive after exhaustion of health. After his death, the player is prompted to immediately delete all his work and start over, or to explore the world before doing so.

Observer. In this mode, players can fly as in "Creative", but have the ability to fly through blocks and look from the face of any player or creature. However, players cannot place or destroy blocks. In this mode, as in "Creative", you can only die by flying outside the world or by typing the special command /kill. Flight mode cannot be turned off. When flying through solid blocks, the nearest cavities in the thickness of the blocks are visible.
