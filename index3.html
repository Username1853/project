    Roblox (/ˈroʊblɒks/ ⓘ, ROH-bloks) is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program and play games created by themselves or other users. It was created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004, and released to the public in 2006. As of February 2025, the platform has reported an average of 85.3 million daily active users. According to the company, their monthly playerbase includes half of all American children under the age of 16.

    The platform hosts millions of user-created games (officially referred to as "experiences"), all created using a dialect of the programming language Lua and the platform's game engine, Roblox Studio. While Roblox is free-to-play, it features in-game purchases done through its virtual currency known as Robux, and game developers on the platform are able to create items that cost Robux. Furthermore, the platform hosts a large virtual economy centered around those items and Robux. Using the platform's "Developer Exchange" program, creators on the platform are able to exchange their earned Robux for real-world currency. The platform has also been used to host virtual concerts and events, as well as advergames.
    
    Early in Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company. In the second half of the 2010s, the platform began to grow rapidly, and this growth was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2020, over 5,000 games on Roblox had been played over a million times, and over 20 had been played over one billion times. Although Roblox has been positively received by critics, it has faced heavy criticism for its content moderation, which in turn has led to a large amount of sexual or politically extremist material on the platform. It has also been criticized for its alleged exploitative practices toward children and microtransactions. The platform has been restricted or completely blocked in several countries, such as China, Turkey, Jordan, and others.
  Overview
Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system built around user-generated content and games,[1][2] officially referred to as "experiences".[3] Games can be created by any user through the platform's game engine, Roblox Studio,[4] and then shared to and played by other players.[1] The games featured on Roblox vary in genre, from role-playing games to ones centered around escaping prison, among others.[5] The platform is made to appeal to a family-friendly audience, and has been described as a massively multiplayer online game (MMO).[6]

While Roblox is free-to-play, it features a virtual currency known as Robux that can be purchased with real-world money. Robux can be used to purchase virtual items that the player can use on their virtual character (or "avatar") on the platform, or access experiences that require payment.[1] As with games, avatar items on Roblox are mainly user-generated,[7] though most items on the platform were made by Roblox themselves for most of the platform's history.[8] Through the platform's "Developer Exchange" program, creators on the platform are able to exchange their earned Robux to real-world money.[9] In addition, Roblox features a monthly service called "Roblox Premium", with its subscribers gaining access to more features on the platform and a monthly stipend of Robux.[1]</p>
